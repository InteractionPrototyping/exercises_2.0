                    <p>Generally speaking there are two ways for you to determine the design language/framework you can use in your app. You can use a predefined styleguide or you can define your own style. Where both approaches have advantages and disadvantages alike, it is your task to make an educated choice and document it properly. The choice of framework/design language strongly influences the interaction patterns your app is going to employ.</p>
                    <p>While we do not require you to use any framework at all, we strongly suggest you use one. Choice of framework is up to you, however a flexible candidate, that incorporates material design, iOS guidelines as well as customization options is Framework 7.</p>
                    <p>When choosing to follow a predefined design language, be precise and make sure to really follow it. Deviations from a chosen language have to be explained reasonably and the observance of your chosen style will be considered during grading.</p>
