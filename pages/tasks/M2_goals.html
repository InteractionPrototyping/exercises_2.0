            <div>
                <p>Specify your application functional requirements based on your personas and goals in a formal way. Use UML Use Case Diagrams (see Chapter 2 Miles, 2006) to describe the functional requirements of your application (e.g., buying, listening, rating, searching).</p>
                <p>Consider paths from starting the app until performing a certain action/goal (for example, in case of a music application, listening to a specific track). Consider deviations from that path (like, for a music application, "music not found", "music not offline available", or "song preview"). </p>
                <p>Ensure that the requirements match different application functionalities (e.g. media library, media store, playback functionalities). These are of course dependent on the original idea of the app. Use a graphic tools of your choice or an online tool like Creately (register for saving or take a screen shot)</p>

            <div>
                <p>Use your scenarios to create usability requirements and goals. The functional requirements you have already defined in the UML use cases. Check if these requirements are fullfilled with your current prototype. Feel free to adjust your requirements if needed. Note that, usability goals are user oriented and operationally defined.</p>

                <p>Search and familiarize yourself with a set of suitable design principles that reflect the usabilty requirements and goals you specified above. Do not just (or worse: define as not applicable) the buzz-phrased principles, rather read them (and their sub-categories) in detail.</p>
                <p>It is suggested to orientate yourself to the Nielsen's 10 Usability heuristics, and read other rules as information.</p>
