        <p>Before you get started, take the time to get to know your users. Use a qualitative research method or a combination of methods of your choosing with at least 5 participants to better understand your target group. Some ideas (to which you are, however, not limited) include:</p> <br />
        <ul>
            <li class="bullets">A (structured) interview with your participants to find out about their wishes, and ideas as well as potential problems, features, etc. You could also draw inspiration from Microsoft's Inclusive Design Toolkit.</li>
            <li class="bullets">A thinking aloud experiment (Nielsen, 1994) or contextual inquiry, if a similar application already exists.</li>
            <li class="bullets">A diary study over the course of a few days, in order to obtain longitudinal data.A diary study over the course of a few days, in order to obtain longitudinal data.</li>

                <h1 class="title is-6">User Goals and Personas</h1>
                <p>Create 3 personas based on your contextual inquiry or interview. Read this guide provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services on the develpment process and elements of personas.</p>
                <p>Specify user goals linking the personas you created and the information from your contextual inquiry or interview. The goals of the personas are a tool to derive the functionality that is expected of the application. The functionalities should fullfill the users' goals. Focus for this practical course on the experience and end goals of the user.</p>
                <p>You can also familiarize yourselves with the Jobs-To-Be-Done framework, a relatively new technique that focuses on user needs. This approach has grown in prominence in recent years, and can be used complimentary or as an alternative to personas.</p><br />
                <h1 class="title is-6">Scenarios</h1>
                <p>Read chapter 6 on scenarios in Cooper (2007): About Face 3. Write user scenarios (narrative) in which the personas use your mobile app. Use the personas to come up with scenarios in which the app is utilized.</p>
