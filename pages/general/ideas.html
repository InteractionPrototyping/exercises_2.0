            <div>
                <h1 class="title is-4">An exemplary procedure</h1>
                <p>Make a Mind Map of ideas for an interactive mobile application. By interactive, stress is on the interaction between the application and the user, rather than on the application functionality. Think of new and innovative ways how a mobile application can be used, write these down and create a Mind Map. Either make a hand drawn (take a photo) or a software based (see below) Mind Map.</p>
                <p>The primary objective of this mind mapping process is to come up with a application prototype that has both features and functionality. More information regarding features and functionality can be found in Section 2.1 of Nielsen's Guerrilla HCI . As you will see, features are referred to as the horizontal component of prototyping and functionality is the vertical component. The goal of this course is for you to have a broad understanding of the horizontal features (viz. interaction) and to, by the end of the course, have implemented a limited set of the vertical functionality (also, interaction).</p><br/>

                <h1 class="title is-4">Generate ideas and select the best ones</h1>
                <p>According to the creative problem solving process (and general brainstorming rules), strictly separate the two phases convergent (idea generation) and divergent (idea evaluation) thinking. Divergent thinking means a "broad search for many diverse and novel alternatives". Convergent thinking means a "focused and affirmative evaluation of alternatives". Separating those phases ensures, that you explore the topic broadly, consider all relevant factors, and find new alternatives.</p>

                <h2 class="expectation_box_title">Strive for quantity</h2>
                <p>Generate many options to get the chance of finding good options. Whether an option is good or bad is judgment and therefore deferred.</p>

                <p>“Wild and crazy” or “childish” ideas have great potential, even if it’s easier to develop than to implement!</p>

                <h2 class="expectation_box_title">Apply affirmative judgment</h2>
                <p>Search for value instead of problems, this creates a positive attitude towards new (never perfect) ideas and their realization.</p>

                <h2 class="expectation_box_title">Check your objectives</h2>
                <p>Options are answers to a question, always check the original question and whether or not an idea is on target.</p>

            <div class="expectation_box">
                <h2 class="expectation_box_title">Keep novelty alive</h2>
                <p>New options are created also because existing solutions are not satisfactory, so always consider the novelty of an option.</p>

                <h2 class="expectation_box_title">Improve ideas</h2>
                <p>An idea is a seed that needs time and care. Keep in mind to develop them further.</p>

                <p>Apply creativity techniques or creative thought processes for both divergent (e.g. brainstorming, ...) and convergent (e.g. telescoping, COCD Box, ...) phases (a good summarizing book is "Thinking tools for creativity and innovation" by Florian Rustler). Useful tools are post-its and glue dots.</p>

                <h2><b>Mind mapping</b></h2>
            <p>Mind mapping is a technique that can assist the process and document the results of a brain storm session. Read the mind mapping introduction on wikihow, which gives you a short description of the basics of the mind mapping technique. The website "Mind mapping software blog" goes into more detail on how to improve your mind map using color, keywords and images.</p>
                <p>There are many free mind mapping tools you can use. One of them is FreeMind, which is a software written in Java that can be freely downloaded.</p>
